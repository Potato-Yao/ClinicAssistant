<h1>
    About The ClinicAssistant
</h1>

When repairing laptops in the computer clinic, we often need to use multiple tools to check laptop's state, change system settings, perform stress test and so on, which is not convenient to switching between different tools.

<br>

Thus, I developed this program, to make most common used operations can be done by "one click".

<br>

Thank you for using ClinicAssistant!
